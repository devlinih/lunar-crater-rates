# Lunar Crater Rates

An "Astronomy and Statistics" project at Olin College of Engineering.

# Notes to Reviewer

This notebook makes use of a custom database we generated (see craters_children.py) using the full Robbins (2018) database as well as an additional database, Yang et al. (2020). Our database and the Yang database required to run this notebook were included in this archive.

To install all the libraries required to run the notebook, we included a requirements.txt file. Run in a terminal, not Python, pip install -r requirements.txt to make all of the dependencies available. You may need to restart your Jupyter kernel after doing this.
